    "Version control allows multiple people to work asynchronously and merge contributions at any time. It tracks what you are working on and what others are working on so the changes aren’t clashed and overridden, therefore allowing more efficient collaborating work. This is useful in science for facilitating collaboration when there are multiple authors that contribute to manuscript preparations. The research process is often informal and haphazard. So, version control can help to organize the process and back up against possible data loss from the multiple revisions of papers, code, and datasets are saved as duplicate copies with uninformative file names. This back up is useful with lab notebooks – containing detailed useful information over the course of a project. Another aspect of version control that would be important in science is how it allows researchers freedom to explore new ideas and methods. Because each version of a project is saved separately, it is easy to explore alternate ideas in a structured and documented way without disrupting the central flow of a project. If these changes don’t work out, reverting changes back to an earlier commit would still be simple."
